# Sa11y
Sa11y is an accessibility quality assurance tool that visually highlights common accessibility and usability issues. Geared towards content authors, Sa11y straightforwardly identifies errors or warnings at the source with a simple tooltip on how to fix them. 

Sa11y works as a simple in-page checker that is designed to be easily customized and integrated into any content management system (CMS) to facilitate good accessibility practices. Sa11y works best in a templated CMS environment, although is also available as a bookmarklet. Sa11y is _not_ a comprehensive code analysis tool. Sa11y exclusively highlights content issues.

- Over 50 test conditions.
- Free and open source.
- Concise tooltips explain issues right at the source.
- Low tech: No complex API or integrations. Vanilla JavaScript. Minimal dependencies. 
- Easily customizable: add your custom rulesets.
- Automatic: checks content on page load.
- Additional (toggleable) checks: Contrast, form labels, readability, links (Advanced).
- Dark mode.

## Installation
Sa11y uses [Tippy.js](https://github.com/atomiks/tippyjs), a highly customizable tooltip library that features a positioning system. To install on your website, insert Sa11y right before the closing `</body>` tag. Include both Tippy.js and Popper.js before Sa11y. Sa11y consists of three files (located in `/src/`).

- **sa11y.css**: The main stylesheet. Should be included in the `<head>` of the document (if possible).
- **sa11y-english.js**: All text strings and tooltip messages are located here for easy translation.
- **sa11y.js**: Contains all logic and rulesets.

### Example installation:
```html
<!-- Stylesheet -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="sa11y.css"/>

<!-- Tippy.js V6 CDN (tooltip library) -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@popperjs/core@2"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@6"></script>

<!-- Sa11y (fork the latest code from GitHub) -->
<script src="sa11y-english.js"></script>
<script src="sa11y.js"></script>

<!-- Instantiate-->
<script>
    const sa11y = new Sa11y();
</script>
```

### Advanced configuration and props
Customize the experience for content editors. Add exclusions to ignore false positives. Set the main scan area - if your content editors can't edit it, don't flag it! Example configuration:
```html
<script>
    const sa11y = new Sa11y({
        checkRoot: 'main',
        readabilityRoot: 'main',
        formLabelsPlugin: false, // E.g. no forms on website.
    });
</script>
```

#### Other notes
- This version appends tooltips to the end of the body by default to ensure tooltips do not get hidden by conflicting CSS styling. If you customize the tooltips to include interactive content, please read [Tippy.js documentation on creating accessible interactive tooltips for keyboard users.](https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/v6/accessibility/#interactivity)

### Create your own rule sets
1. Create your condition (within the QA module for example).
2. Add `this.warningCount++;` or `this.errorCount++;` to update warning or error count.
3. Add respective CSS classes.
4. Add warning or error button before (or after) element using the `this.annotate` function, followed by the type `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `GOOD`. Finally, reference your tooltip message.

#### Example: Warn content authors of overusing a component.
The example condition detects if more than one announcement is detected on a page. If it detects more than one instance of the .announcement-component CSS class, it will be indicated as a warning. The warning button will only appear on every instance except the first component. `M['QA_TOO_MANY_COMPONENTS_EXAMPLE']` represents a string (tooltip message).

```javascript
const $checkAnnouncement = document.querySelectorAll(".announcement-component");
if ($checkAnnouncement.length > 1) {
    this.warningCount++;
    for (let i = 1; i < $checkAnnouncement.length; i++) {
        $checkAnnouncement[i].classList.add("sa11y-warning-border");
        $checkAnnouncement[i].insertAdjacentHTML("beforebegin", this.annotate(M["WARNING"], M["QA_TOO_MANY_COMPONENTS_EXAMPLE"]));
    }
}
```
